# TODO

Direction: the agent runtime you can safely hand untrusted tools and untrusted
prompts. Every tool and provider is a WASM component that never sees an API key
and can only reach what its config allows. Make that visible, enforceable, and
the reason to pick runner.

Focus: background agents that are secure and auditable. Nobody is watching a
background run, so what it may do is fixed before it starts, and the audit log
is how you find out what happened. Agents are the unit of capability: no separate grant
system; for narrower access, define a narrower agent.

## 1. Use other people's tools safely

- component registry: signed, content-addressed components with capability manifests
  - `runner tools add <source>` shows a permission prompt before install
  - settle the manifest format early; it shapes the WIT interfaces
- a tool to write tools: agent writes a tool, it compiles to a component, runs with no network/filesystem by default, and goes live only after its permissions are approved

## 2. Portability and determinism

- record/replay (also a strong audit tool for background runs): capture a run's provider responses and HTTP traffic and replay exactly, for debugging, evals, and regression tests (builds on the deterministic test harness)
- portable agents: bundle prompt, tools, and permissions into one artifact that runs with the same guarantees anywhere

## Service foundation

Implemented: local daemon and CLI, durable run queue and event replay, cancellation,
deadlines, session serialization, and restart recovery. Next milestones and API:
