# TODO

## Long term

- schedule tasks - see docs/service.md for one-off and recurring task semantics
- agent to agent communication
- memory
- component registry
- OAuth/login
- switch build target to wasm32-wasip3 once Rust 1.100 ships it on stable (~late Nov 2026)
- migrate tools to WASI 0.3 http (off wstd) - wait for a p3 wstd or a need for streaming tool output / parallel tool calls
- wasm inspector - turn to s-expression and have llm read it - inspect agents and tools
- wasm shell
- security audit logging alongside debug logs
  - threat model: malicious guest components; trust the runner and host to enforce policy and record activity
  - add structured, versioned events with event IDs, sequence numbers, actor/run/session identity, component version, action, policy decision, and outcome
  - record activity at host-controlled boundaries so guests cannot forge, suppress, or bypass records; bound and escape guest-controlled metadata
  - use durable host-owned storage inaccessible to guests; define behavior when storage fails or guests flood the audit stream, including which actions must block
  - cover tool execution, allowed and denied network/filesystem access, capability violations, and guest traps or resource-limit termination
  - define retention, audit access controls, alerts, and detection of missing events or collector outages
  - keep audit records metadata-only: omit prompts, credentials, tool payloads, and raw errors
- add an agent that can audit security

- dynamic agent definitions for delegation
  - create temporary specialists or override static presets with task-specific instructions, models, and tool selections
  - restrict choices to host-approved providers/models, tools, and delegation targets; a guest cannot expand its delegation authority
  - define lifetime, ownership, quotas, persistence/restart behavior, and whether definitions can be reused across turns
  - retain supervised cancellation, isolated sessions, depth/fan-out limits, and metadata-only activity logs
  - add runnable examples for creating a specialist and collecting its result

## Service foundation

Implemented: local daemon and CLI, durable run queue and event replay, cancellation,
deadlines, session serialization, and restart recovery. Next milestones and API:
[docs/service.md](docs/service.md).
